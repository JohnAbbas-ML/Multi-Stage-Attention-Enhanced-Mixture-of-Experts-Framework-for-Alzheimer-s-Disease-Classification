# Alzheimer Mixture of Experts (MoE) Model

This repository contains a **PyTorch implementation** of a **Mixture of Experts (MoE) model** with **Dense Blocks**, **Channel Attention**, and **Spatial Attention** for Alzheimer’s disease classification.

The model is designed with:
- **DenseNet-style Dense Blocks** for efficient feature reuse.  
- **Channel Attention** and **Spatial Attention** mechanisms for adaptive feature refinement.  
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** with a **Gating Network** for dynamic expert selection.  
- **Auxiliary Classifier** for intermediate supervision.  

## 🚀 Usage

### Run the model

```bash
python alzheimer_moe.py
```

### What it does

* Builds the **AlzheimerMoEModel**
* Prints the full **architecture summary** (using `torchsummary`)
* Runs a **dummy forward pass** with input shape `(1, 3, 224, 224)`
* Prints the shape of the **main classifier output** and **auxiliary classifier output**

---

## 🏗 Model Architecture

The model has three **Mixture of Experts stages**, each containing multiple experts:

* Experts alternate between **Channel Attention** and **Spatial Attention**.
* A **Gating Network** dynamically routes features to experts.
* Outputs are combined and passed through a **Transition Layer**.

After three stages:

* An **auxiliary classifier** produces an early prediction.
* A **global average pooling + fully connected head** produces the final classification.

## 📊 Example Output

After running:

```
===== Model Architecture =====

... (torchsummary output here) ...

===== Forward Pass Test =====
Main output shape: torch.Size([1, 3])
Auxiliary output shape: torch.Size([1, 3])
```

## 🧠 Applications

This architecture can be applied to:

* Alzheimer’s disease classification from MRI or PET scans
* General medical image analysis tasks requiring attention + MoE
* Any multi-class classification problem with complex features
